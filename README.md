# StarfighterPatrol

This is a one-dimensional starfighter game. Pressing B reverses direction, A fires your lasers. You need to clear the purple asteroids that are a hazard to hyperspace navigation. You can move to a new region by hitting A4. Or if you choose restart the game with A3. When you've been hit 5 times your score (number of asteroids cleared) will show before the game restarts.
In the CircuitPython version you restart when you hit A or B. The Makecode/Javascript version will restart after a pause.
